serverless-slackbot
===================

A Serverless Module featuring a ready-for-action SlackBot that you can package up as a Slack Application and distribute, without servers!

We love Slack and their RTM (websockets) API is cool but we want to build bots without maintaining and paying for servers (we're Serverless).

So, we built a powerful SlackBot that runs purely on *AWS Lambda*, *API Gateway* & *DynamoDB*.
